Hi.






































Are you still here?
Guess I actually have to introduce myself then.
I'm someone. I don't give out my real name, unless I know you personally.
I have a discord, I guess. person#5099. No capitals. If you want to friend me then tell me you are from github.
(Otherwise I will probably think you are a bot and ignore you.)
If I don't talk to you, don't take it personally. I am probably busy, or asleep.
I guess maybe I do stuff. Sometimes. My hobbies are; Minecraft, Coding and being Emo.
I don't really care what you think of the above stuff, but don't ever insult my friends.
Insult me instead. I _don't_ care.
